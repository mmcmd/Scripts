/r/sysadmin scripts
===================

This is a repository of helpful administration scripts compiled and created by the [Sysadmin community on Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/sysadmin).

The goal of this repository is to server as a central location to keep track of useful scripts and snippits, as well as an educational resource for new system administrators. As such, a set of standards will be maintained to ensure that code is accurate, safe, efficient, readable, and scalable.

Some things are out of scope for this respository, full blown configuration management solutions being an example. Other things are too simple to include, like a `netsh` one-liner to set a static IP.

Currently managed by the [__/r/sysadmin moderation team__](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/about/moderators) and __agentsnazz__ ([/u/Cat5InTheCradle](http://reddit.com/u/Cat5InTheCradle)).
